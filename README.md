# zyte
> A lightweight application that parses and builds a Javascript based web application with a limited file size. 

### How to use PHP parser:

- you need the following files in a relative directory with *zyte.php*

> *zyte.config* - configuration file
> *main.html* - html, head, meta settings, body go here.
> *app.css* - all the CSS for the web app
> *app.js* - all Javascript for the web app


### Project status:
- PHP Parser complete, 
- Python script compiler, still a work in progress
